    \begin{center}
        Welcome along to the first meeting of Prime Time!
    \end{center}
    This is a club where we look at the fun an interesting topics in mathematics. All students from all grades are welcome to attend. Each week you will be introduced to a concept or a problem in mathematics, these are meant to challenge you, the following week we will share and discuss our solutions.

%%%% Introduction to the General Template %%%%
\section{Ready!}
    Each week we will get ready with some smaller maths puzzles.
    Today we will get started with some patterns.

    \begin{problem}{Continue the pattern then write the rule}{8cm}
        \vspace{5mm}
        a. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., % Geometric Sequence i,e (Common Ratio) of *2; Next number is 64
        \vspace{0.5cm}

        b. 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, ..., % Arithmetic Sequence i.e (Common Difference) of +3; Next number is 19
        \vspace{0.5cm}

        c. 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ..., % The Triangular Numbers Numbers that can be arranged in to a triangular shape; Next number is 28
        \vspace{0.5cm}
    \end{problem}

\section{Set!}
    \begin{problem}{Moser's Circle Problem}
     Below are several circles with n points on circles for n = 2, 3, 4, 5 and chords (line segments whose endpoints are on the circle) connecting the points. The points on the circle are chosen such that no three chords intersect at a single point inside the circle.\\

        \end{center}
     
     a. Count the number of non-overlapping regions created by the chords.
     
     b. Complete the table.
     \begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.8\textwidth} { 
  | >{\hsize=.4\textwidth\raggedleft\arraybackslash}X|| >{\centering\arraybackslash}X | >{\centering\arraybackslash}X | >{\centering\arraybackslash}X | >{\centering\arraybackslash}X | }
 \hline
 $n$, number of points & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
 \hline
 number of non-overlapping regions  & 2  & 4 &  &  \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}
c. What is the rule for the sequence? \emph{Write your answer in terms of $n$}

d. Predict the next number in the sequence.
